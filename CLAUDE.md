# Poker Monkey — Claude Context

## Session startup (do this at the start of EVERY session)

1. **Greet and recap** — Show the last 5 commits so the user knows where things left off
2. **Confirm who's here** — Ask: "Who's working today?" (Brian works on `main`; there is at least one other collaborator)
3. **Confirm branch** — Ask which branch to work on, then run `git checkout <branch> && git pull origin <branch>` to make sure we're up to date
4. **Confirm server state** — Check if local server is running (`lsof -i:3843`) and offer to start it if not

Example opening:
> Here's where we left off: [last 5 commits]
> Who's working today, and which branch?

Do not skip this. Do not assume it's Brian or that we're on `main` without asking first.

## What this is
1v1 Texas Hold'em matchmaking app (chess.com style). Players queue up, get paired, play heads-up NL Hold'em, ELO rating updates after each match. Full hand history stored in Postgres. Real-time via Socket.IO.

**Live:** https://poker-production-d726.up.railway.app  
**Repo:** https://github.com/briandanilo/poker.git  
**Current version:** v4.2 — bump `VERSION` in `client/src/config.js` on **every single commit**

---

## Stack
- **Server:** Node/Express + Socket.IO (`server/index.js`) + pg + ioredis
- **Client:** React Native (Expo SDK 54) — `client/` — Android, iOS, web
- **DB:** Railway Postgres
- **Cache:** Railway Redis — live game snapshot + hand event log per hand
- **Deploy:** Railway — auto-deploys on push to `main`

---

## Dev workflow

### Always use prod server
Client always connects to `https://poker-production-d726.up.railway.app` by default.

**`client/.env`** (gitignored):
```
# Uncomment for emulator-only local dev:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3843
```

**`server/.env`** (gitignored):
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...@shortline.proxy.rlwy.net:35104/railway
REDIS_URL=redis://default:...@acela.proxy.rlwy.net:44840
```

### Run local server
```bash
cd server && node index.js   # port 3843
```

### Run Expo
```bash
cd client && ./node_modules/.bin/expo start
```
⚠️ Always use `./node_modules/.bin/expo`, never `npx expo` (pulls wrong version).

Press `a` for Android emulator, `w` for web, scan QR for physical device.

### Android emulator
```bash
~/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator -avd Pixel_8 -no-audio -no-boot-anim -gpu host &
```
- Pixel 8 AVD, API 37, **must have 4GB RAM** (`hw.ramSize=4096` in `~/.android/avd/Pixel_8.avd/config.ini`)
- Kill Metro only: `lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9` — never `pkill -f expo`

### Deploy
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "vX.Y: description" && git push origin main
```

---

## Screen flow
```
LoginScreen → LobbyScreen → GameScreen
                          ↳ ProfileScreen (from hamburger on either screen)
                          ↳ HandReplayScreen (from ProfileScreen match history)
```

- **LoginScreen** — Google Sign In (mobile only) + guest (name + avatar + Join). Auto-login from AsyncStorage.
- **LobbyScreen** — "Hi {name}!", dashboard cards (recent games, friends placeholder, leaderboard placeholder), PLAY! button, Active Tables list, Players Online Now list
- **GameScreen** — felt table, opponent pod + my pod, cards extending toward table, community cards, pot, betting controls, match-over modal with ELO + rematch
- **ProfileScreen** — username/avatar editor, 4-color deck toggle, match history list (clickable)
- **HandReplayScreen** — hand tabs, event log, ⏮◀▶⏭ controls to step through every action

Navigation: `@react-navigation/stack`, `headerShown: false`, `fade` animation.

---

## Matchmaking flow
1. Player hits PLAY! → `find-match` socket event
2. If opponent waiting → instant pair → `match-found` → both navigate to GameScreen
3. If no opponent → `in-queue` → spinner + Cancel
4. Game plays out (hand events logged to Redis → flushed to Postgres at hand end)
5. One player busted → `match-over` event with ELO change
6. Match-over modal: Play Again (rematch as new match) or Leave → Lobby

**Rematch** = brand new match with `previous_match_id` pointing to the match it came from. Two rematches = three separate history entries.

---

## Architecture

### Data layers
| Layer | What lives there |
|---|---|
| **Postgres** | Players, matches, hands, hand events, ELO — permanent |
| **Redis** | Live game snapshot (crash recovery) + append-only hand event log |
| **Server memory** | Active matches Map, socket→player Map, matchmaking queue |
| **AsyncStorage** | Player UUID + display name + avatar (persists across sessions on same device) |

### DB schema
```
players       — id TEXT PK, display_name, avatar_id, is_guest, created_at, last_seen_at
player_stats  — player_id FK, elo, matches_played, matches_won
matches       — id, uuid, player1_id FK, player2_id FK, status, winner_id FK,
                elo_before/after for each, previous_match_id FK (null = first match)
hands         — id, match_id FK, hand_uuid, hand_number, pot, community_cards, winner_id FK, winning_hand
hand_events   — id, hand_id FK, sequence_num, event_type, player_id FK, amount, phase, data JSONB
```

### Identity model
- **UUID is the PK** — never use display_name as a key or FK
- **Google users**: UUID = `g_<google_sub>` — permanent across devices
- **Guest users**: UUID = random, stored in AsyncStorage — persists on same device/browser, lost on cache clear
- **display_name** is mutable — always join `players` table to resolve names for display

### Hand logging
1. Every action → `server/handLogger.js` → appended to Redis Stream `room:{matchId}:hand:{uuid}:events`
2. Redis snapshot updated on every action → `room:{matchId}:snapshot`
3. On hand end → `flushHandToDb()` bulk-inserts all events into `hand_events`, creates `hands` row
4. Redis hand key cleared for next hand

### ELO
- K=32, standard formula
- Written to `player_stats` at match end
- Guest and Google users both tracked by UUID

## HTTP routes
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

| POST | `/api/player/guest` | Upsert guest player into players table |
| POST | `/auth/google` | Google token → upsert player, return playerId |
| POST | `/admin/reset` | Wipe all in-memory match state, emit reset to all clients |

| Postgres | DB — public URL in server/.env |
| Redis | Cache — public URL in server/.env |

---

## Known bugs / watchlist
- **Observer leak**: navigating away from observed game doesn't emit `unobserve`. Server keeps sending `game-state` to the stale socket which triggers navigation back to GameScreen. Fix: emit `unobserve` on lobby navigation.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Socket connects to wrong URL on physical device
`EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` uses `localhost` which only works in emulator (rewritten to `10.0.2.2`). Physical device should use prod — keep `.env` commented out.

### Metro cache stale after .env change
`r` (reload) doesn't re-read `.env`. Must fully restart: `Ctrl+C` then `./node_modules/.bin/expo start --clear`

### DO NOT USE react-native-reanimated
Expo Go SDK 54 bundled native Reanimated causes `TurboModule installTurboModule` crash. `TimerRing` uses `setInterval` instead.

### Emulator OOM
`sed -i '' 's/hw.ramSize=2048/hw.ramSize=4096/' ~/.android/avd/Pixel_8.avd/config.ini`

### Hand history shows "No hand history"
Means the hand flush to Postgres failed (usually FK constraint because player wasn't in `players` table yet). Fixed in v3.7 — `ensurePlayers()` runs before any inserts.

### VERSION not updating on screen
The actual `config.js` file must be edited — bumping in the commit message only is not enough. Always edit `export const VERSION = 'vX.Y'` in the file.
